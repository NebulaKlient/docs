<Accordion title="General" icon="option" iconType="duotone">
  - **Disable extra descend**: Restricts how far a fall is allowed when calculating paths.
  - **Disable extra ascend**: Excludes Jump Boost effects when calculating paths.
  - **Jumping Prediction Mode**: Selects the algorithm for predicting when to jump.
  <Expandable title="Prediction Modes">
    - **Automatic**
    - **Force enabled**
    - **Force disabled**
  </Expandable>
  - **Jump on lower speeds**: Jumps when running is slower than jumping - Running is only better at higher speeds.
  - **Allow Omni-Sprinting**: Sprints in all directions when moving backwards.
  - **World Caching**: Caches the world depending on where you have been. The fastest way to cache the world is by teleporting around the map.
    <Tip>
      Always keep this on, greatly improves pathfinding results.
    </Tip>
  - **Movement Type (BETA)**: Changes the path following behavior.
    - **Precise**: Follows the path exactly.
    - **Legit**: Follows the path with more human-like variations.
  - **Anti-Stuck Timeout (in ticks)**: Waits before trying to get unstuck (Default: 60 ticks = 3 seconds).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Rotations" icon="angle-90" iconType="duotone">
  - **Walking Rotation Type**:
    - **Smooth**: More linear rotations resulting in smooth rotations, recommended with precise movement type.
    - **Legit**: Less rotations but more snappy and random, resulting in a more legit looking rotation, recommended with legit movement type.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Routes" icon="map-location-dot" iconType="duotone">
  - **Disable RT Checks for Etherwarp**: Disables validation of etherwarp points before running a route.
  - **Open Route Selector Screen**: Binds to open the global route creator.
  - **Open Route Editor Screen**: Opens the editor gui for the route you're currently editing.
  - **Reload loaded routes**: Force reloads all your saved routes.
  - **Render Waypoints Of Editing Route**: Shows all created waypoints in your current route.
